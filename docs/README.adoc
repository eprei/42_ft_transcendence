== Project overview

=== Page 1: Welcome

==== Functionalities:

* Login with the intranet OAuth system 42

==== Technical requirements:

* Communication with OAuth 42

==== Graphical requirements:

* Background, login button

image::assets/Page1.1_Welcome.png[welcome preview]

=== Page 2: Compte utilisateur

==== 2.1 Profile

==== Functionalities:

* You can choose a (unique) username to be displayed on the site. We start with the default name taken from OAuth 42 (?)
* You can upload an avatar. If you don't, it is by default to your 42 profile picture (?)
* You can enable two-factor authentication, 2FA (Google Authenticator or send sms to mobile phone)
* Add other users as friends and view real time status (online, offline, playing, etc.)

==== Technical needs:

* Get via OAuth 42 the photo and name and assign them as default values to AVATAR and USERNAME
* Username, verify that it does not exist as it has to be unique
* Be able to upload a photo as avatar
* Integration of 2FA
* Get user statistics

==== Graphical requirements:

* Profile window with data:
** Username (editable)
** Avatar (editable)
** 2FA (on / off)
* Statistics
** Victories and defeats
** Rank
** Level
** Achievements
** Etc.
* Button to add friends and see their status

==== Functionalities:

* Display of history including 1 vs 1, levels and so on. Anyone who is logged in should be able to consult it

==== Technical requirements:

* Get history

==== Graphical requirements:

* Table with history

==== Functionalities :

* Create channels
** public
** private
** password protected
* Join a channel (not requested by the subject but it is logical to add it)
* Send direct messages to other users
* Block other users
* Invite other users to play pong
* Access to other players' profiles

==== Technical requirements:

_To be completed..._

==== Graphic requirements:

_Design made directly from the description of the subject to optimise time_

=== Page 4: The game

==== Functionalities:

* Launch the game of pong against another player
* Matching system (waiting list)
* Canvas with the game
* Customisation options (we have to define which ones)
* The game must be responsive
