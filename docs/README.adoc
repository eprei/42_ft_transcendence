=== Page 1: Welcome

==== Functionalities:

- Login with the intranet OAuth system 42

==== Technical requirements:

- Communication with OAuth 42

==== Graphical requirements:

- Background, login button 

=== Page 2: Compte utilisateur

==== 2.1 Profile

==== Functionalities:

- You can choose a (unique) username to be displayed on the site. We start with the default name taken from OAuth 42 (?)
- You can upload an avatar. If you don't, it defaults to your 42 profile picture (?)
- You can enable two-factor authentication, 2FA (Google Authenticator or send sms to mobile phone)
- Add other users as friends and view real time status (online, offline, playing, etc.)

==== Technical needs:

- Get via OAuth 42 the photo and name and assign them as default values to AVATAR and USERNAME
- Username, verify that it does not exist as it has to be unique
- Be able to upload a photo as avatar
- Integration of 2FA
- Get user statistics

==== Graphical requirements:

	- Profile window with data: USERNAME (editable), AVATAR (editable), 2FA (on / off)
	- Statistics such as victories and defeats, rank and levels, achievements, etc
	- Button to add friends and see their status

==== Functionalities:
	
- Display of history including 1 vs 1, levels and so on. Anyone who is logged in should be able to consult it

==== Technical requirements:

==== Graphical requirements:

- Table with history


=== Page 3: Chat

==== Functionalities :

- Create channels (public, private or password protected)
- Send direct messages to other users
- Block other users
- Invite other users to play pong
- Access to other players' profiles

==== Technical requirements:

_To be completed..._
	
==== Graphic requirements:

=== Page 4 - The game

==== Functionalities:
